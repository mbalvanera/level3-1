        <div>
        The essence of<br> your being is here<br> to stay<br>
        </div>
        <p> 
as it infuses with my skin and heart and eyes and touch
        </p>
        <p>
my skin<br> has been tattooed through your caress<br>
and my heart has been<br> mended by the way your<br> eyes peer into my soul you fill me with love and <br>make me whole
        </p>
        <p>
in retrospect i truly<br> thought i knew what love was<br>
but this was all a lie until i had met you<br>
masochistic obsession is all i was familiar with
blinking the past away<br>
i am aware of you and our future and our present<br>
and how i will never let that get away<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        I never knew you could know<br> me so much better<br>
I ignored all the great weather<br> 
the darkest cloud hung over me and<br> I<br> let my head fall on the air<br>
my hair was still wet but not the day<br> that we met
        </p>
        <p>
Was it someone like you who did it<br> to be so kind<br>
Leaves on the grass with words drawn<br> out<br>
You admired me and wanted to hold my<br> hand
I let the curtains fly in<br>
Didn’t want the wind to pass me by<br>
        </p>
        <p>
Wearing the t-shirts with the cheesiest slogans<br>
Dropping love on my sleeve<br>
Too many wishes that I hope they’re not an omen<br>
I never knew a heart could beat for<br> me
        </p>
        
    </body>
